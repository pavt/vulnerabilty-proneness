# 🔍 Vulnerability Analysis in GitHub Actions

This project performs a comprehensive vulnerability analysis in GitHub Actions, focusing on RQ1 and RQ2. It processes vulnerability data from predefined files and generates structured results for interpretation and visualization.

## 📌 Analysis Overview

The analysis addresses the following research questions:

- **RQ1. Vulnerability-Proneness and Popularity.**  
  *How does vulnerability-proneness relate to the adoption and popularity of third-party Actions?*  

- **RQ2. Vulnerability-Proneness Across Categories.**  
  *How does vulnerability-proneness relate to different GitHub Marketplace categories?*  

### 📂 Input Data

The data is sourced from the following files:

- `data/1_dependencies_sorted.csv` → Contains information about vulnerabilities in dependencies used in GitHub Actions.
- `data/1_source_code_sorted.csv` → Contains vulnerabilities detected in the source code of GitHub Actions.

### 📁 Output Results

The analysis results are stored in the following directory:

- `results/` → Contains the generated charts, tables, and reports based on the analysis.
